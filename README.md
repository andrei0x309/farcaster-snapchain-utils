# farcaster-snapchain-utils

## Description

This is a library to simplify the interaction with a Farcaster snapchain node.

It can be used in read-only mode or in read/write mode.

If you use it in read/write mode, you will need to provide a private key and a FID.

If a node is not provided, the library will use the Pinata public node.

You can also use it with Neynar, provided you pass the NEYNAR_API_KEY to the constructor or to changeNode the method.

The library allows you to change the node or signer, so you don't need to create a new instance every time you want to change the node or signer.
